# RGBDS Basic Template

This repository provides a basic template for Gameboy development using RGBDS. The `game.asm` file is the starting point for your Gameboy project.

This template is based on the example provided at [gbdev.io](https://gbdev.io/gb-asm-tutorial/part1/hello_world.html).

## Development Environment

The recommended development environment for this project is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This repository includes a preconfigured VSCode setup in the `.vscode` directory.

The following VSCode extensions are recommended for this project:

* [RGBDS Z80 Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donaldhays.rgbds-z80): Provides support for `*.asm` files.
* [Emulicious Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emulicious.emulicious-debugger): Enables debugging of Gameboy games.

## Build Toolchain

The [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/) toolchain, which has been used for building Gameboy games in Assembly since 1996, is required for this project. You can install it using the following command (Mac users):

```shell
brew install rgbds
```

Additional installation information for other OSes can be found [here](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/install).

## Emulator

This project uses the [Emulicious](https://emulicious.net/) emulator. The emulator is included in this repository, so there is no need for additional downloads. However, you will need to install [JAVA](https://www.java.com/en/download/) to run it.

To enable remote debugging in Emulicious, navigate to `Tools` > `Remote Debugging` and enable it.

## Additional Files

This project includes the [hardware.inc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbdev/hardware.inc/v4.0/hardware.inc) file, which serves as the standard library for Gameboy ASM.

You are not supposed to modify this file, but just import it in your code.

## Building the ROM

To build the project, press `Shift + Cmd + B`. This will execute the commands defined in the `.vscode/tasks.json` file:

```shell
mkdir build
```

```shell
rgbasm -Werror -Weverything game.asm -o build/game.o

# -Werror - This turns all warnings into errors. It is highly recommended to treat warnings as errors, as ignoring them will eventually backfire.

# -Weverything - This enables all warnings. While warnings are completely optional, taking them into account dramatically improves code health and makes programs more robust. However, note that some warnings may incorrectly indicate errors in valid code, i.e. those warnings may generate false positives. For personal projects, it is totally acceptable to use -Wall -Wextra instead of -Weverything, as it covers the most important warnings while dramatically lowering the odds of false positives.
```

```shell
rgblink build/game.o -o build/game.gb


# --dmg - This disables VRAM and RAM bank switching, because these types of bank switching are only available on the CGB.

# --tiny - This disables ROM bank switching. This type of bank switching is available even on the DMG, but it is only necessary when the ROM size is over 32 KiB. Some early Game Boy games, e.g. Tetris, were fitting in 32 KiB and not using ROM bank switching. You can remove this, if you have a bigger game.
```

```shell
rgbfix  --title MyGame --pad-value 0 --validate build/game.gb

# --title MyGame -- This sets the title of the game. It should be kept under 11 characters.

# --pad-value 0 -- This tells the tool to pad the unused parts of the ROM with zeros. While not necessary, it makes it easier to debug the ROM, as unused ROM regions are easier to spot.

# --validate -- This fixes the Nintendo logo and the checksums in the header. The DMG will check these before running the ROM and wonâ€™t execute any instruction if any of the checks fails.
```

This will create a `build` directory and place the ROM, named `game.gb`, inside it.

Please note that the build process expects a `game.asm` file as your source code.

## Debugging the ROM

To start debugging, press `Shift + CMD + D` and click the Play button for `Launch in Emulicious`.

## Playing the Game

To run the game, either manually run the ROM via an emulator or press `Ctrl + F5`.
